1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The tragedy of McBeth act for, by William Shakespeare.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Drama.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Review and anticipate.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In act 3, McBeth hires murderers to kill Banquo and Banquo's son Fliens.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The murderers botched the job, killing Banquo but allowing Fliens to escape.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then, at a state banquet, McBeth is shocked to see the ghost of Banquo sitting in the king's chair.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
McBeth decides to visit the witches again, determined to know the worst.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
At the end of act 3, we learn that Malcolm is in England preparing to invade Scotland,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and that McBeth has gone to join him.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In act 4, McBeth seeks help from the witches to secure his power.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The forces of good, however, are beginning to gather against him.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Scene 1.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A witch's haunt.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thunder.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Enter the three witches.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thrice the brim did cat-athmute.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thrice and once the hedge pig wine.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Harp your cries.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Dis time.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Dis time.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Round about the cold wringo.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In the poisoned entrails throw, toad that under cold stone days and nights.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Has that he won?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sweltreed venom sleeping got boiled out first either charmed pot.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Double, double, toil and sorrow.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Fire, run and cold run, bubble.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Fill it up a thinny snake in the cauldron boil and bake.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have knew, then, toe of frog, will of that,

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and tongue of dog, adors fork and blind worm sting.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Lizard's leg and howl it's wing for a charm of powerful trouble.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Like a hill-broth boil and bubble.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Double, toil and sorrow.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fire, burn and cold run, bubble.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, which is mummy, more and gulf of the raven, soapsy shark.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Root of am luck did did the dark.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Liver of blaspheming dew, gall of goat and slips of you,

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
slivered in the moon's eclipse.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Knows of jerk and tartars lips.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Finger of births, strangled, babed, ditched, delivered by a trap.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Make the girl thick and slab.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Add there to a tiger's chor'd run for the ingredients of our cold run.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Double, toil and sorrow.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Fire, burn and cold run, bubble.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Cool it with a baboon's blood, then the charm is firm and good.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Enter heckety.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Well done, I commend your pains and everyone shall share the gains.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And how about the cold run, sing? Like hills and fairies it ring.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And chanting all that you put in.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Music and a song. Black spirits, etc.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Exit heckety.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
By the prickling of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Open locks, whoever knocks.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Enter McBath.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How now you secret black and midnight haggs? What is it you do?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Addied without name.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I conjure you by that which you profess.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How air you come to know it, answer me.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches,

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
though the yesty waves can found in swallow navigation up,

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
though castles topple on their waters heads,

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations,

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
though the treasure of nature's Germans tumble all together,

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
even till destruction's sicken, answer me to what I ask you.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Speak, demand.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We'll answer.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Say, if the head is rather here it from our mouths,

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
or from our masters.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Call him.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let me see him.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Pour in, south's blood, that have eaten a nine-faro,

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
grease that sweatin' from the murderous gibbet,

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
throw it to the flame.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Come, high all o'er, that self-an office,

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
deathly show thunder, first apparition and armed head.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Tell me they're one-on-power.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He knows life ought, here is speech, but say thou not,

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth, beware Macduff,

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
beware the thane of five, dismiss me, enough.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He descends.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But here thou art for thy good caution, thanks.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thou has hopped my fero right, but one would more.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He will not be commanded, here's another more potent than the first.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thunder, second apparition, a bloody child.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Be bloody, bold, and resolute.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Lapt to scorn the power of man for none of woman born shall harm Macbeth.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Decends.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Then live Macduff, what need I fear of thee, but yet I'll make a sure-and-stouble sure-and-take-a-bond-of-fate.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thou shall not live, that I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and sleep in spite of thunder.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thunder, third apparition, a child crowned with a tree in his hand.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What is this that rises like the issue of a king, and wears upon his baby brow the round-and-top of sovereignty?

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Listen, but speak not to it.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Be lying, metal, proud, and take no care who chaves, who frets, or where conspires are.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until great Burnham would to hide Duns and Inhill shall come against him.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Decends.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That will never be. Who can impress the forest, bid the tree unfixes earthbound route.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sweet boldments good. Rebellious dead rise never till the wood of Burnham rise,

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and our high-pleased Macbeth shall live the leeks of nature pay his breath to time and mortal custom.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yet my heart throbs to know one thing. Tell me if your heart can tell so much.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Shall bankers issue ever rain in this kingdom?

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She too know no more.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I will be satisfied.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Dun I may this an eternal curse fall on you. Let me know why things that call it and what noise is this.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hold boys.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Show. Show. Show. Show. Show is I, and Grease out come like shadows.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So depart.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A show of eight kings and bank will last king with a glass in his hand.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There are two like the spirit of bank will down by crown does see my eyelids and I hear.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Though other goldbound brow is like the first. A third is like the former.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Fear of they hags why do you show me this? A fourth.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Start eyes. But with the line straight up to the crack of doom. Another yet.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Our seventh I will see no more.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And yet the eighth appears. Who bears a glass which shows me many more.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And some I see that twofold balls and treble septice carry.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Horrible sight.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now I see it is true. For the blood bolted bank will smiles upon me and points it for his.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is this so?

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I sir. All this is so. But why stands Macbeth thus amazingly.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Consisters cheer we up his sprites and show the best of our delights.

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll charm the air to give a sound while you perform your antic round.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That this great king make Ingley say our duties did his welcome day.

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Music the witches dance and vanish.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Where are they? Come? Let this pernicious hour stand I a cursive in the calendar.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come in without there.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Enter Lennox.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's your grace as will?

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you the weird sisters?

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No my lord.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Came they not by you? No indeed my lord.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Infected be the air where on they ride and damned all those that trust them.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I did hear the galloping of horses who was came by.

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
His two or three my lord that bring you word Macbeth is fled to England.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Flight to England?

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm a good lord.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Aside.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Time though anticipates my dread exploits. The flighty purpose never is or took unless the deed go with it.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
From this moment the very first things of my heart shall be the first things of my hand.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And even now to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The castle of Macduff.

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will surprise.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Seize upon five.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Give to the edge of the sword his wife, his babes and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No boasting like a fool.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This deed I'll do before the purpose cool.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But no more sights.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Where are these gentlemen? Come bring me where they are.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Exit.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Seen two Macduff's castle.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Enter Macduff's wife, her son and Ross.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What had he done to make him fly the land?

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You must have patience madam.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He had none. His flight was madness.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What our actions do not are fears to make us traders.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wisdom.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
To leave his wife, to leave his babes, his mansion and his titles,

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
in a place from whens himself does fly?

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He loves us not.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He wants the natural touch.

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
For the poor ran the most dominative of birds will fight her young ones in her nest against the owl.

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All is the fear.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And nothing is the love.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
As little as the wisdom where the flight so runs against all reasons,

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
my dearest cousin.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I pray you are school yourself.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But for your husband he is noble, wise, judicious and best knows the fits of the seasons.

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I dare not speak much further.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But cruel other times when we are traders and do not know ourselves.

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
When we hold room of from what we fear.

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yet no not what we fear but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I take my leave of you.

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She will not be long but I will be here again.

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Things that the worst will see so as climb up what they were before.

177
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
My pretty cousin.

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Blessing upon you.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Father he is and yet he is fatherless.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I am so much a fool.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Should I stay longer?

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I take my leave at once.

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Exit.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sir, your father's dead.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And what will you do now?

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
How will you live?

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
As birds do mother.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What?

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
With worms and flies?

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
With what I get I mean and so do they.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Poor bird.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Does never fear the net nor lie the pitfall nor the gin?

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why should I mother?

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Poor birds.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They are not set for.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
My father is not dead for all you are saying.

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes he is dead.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How will they do for a father?

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How will you do for a husband?

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Why?

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I could buy me 20 at any market.

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Then you buy him to sell again.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The speaks with all thy wit.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And yet he faith with wind enough for thee.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Was my father a trader mother?

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I that he was.

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What is a trader?

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why?

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
One that swears and flies.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And be all traders that do so.

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Everyone that does so is a trader and must be hanged.

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Everyone.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Who must hang them?

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why?

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The honest man.

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Then the liars and swears are fools.

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
For there are liars and swears and no to beat the honest man and hang up them.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How God help thee poor monkey.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But how will thou do for a father?

223
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If he were dead, you'd weak for him.

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you will not, it were a good sign that I could quickly have a new father.

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Poor Bratler.

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How thou darkest?

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Enter a messenger.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Bless you, Feldem.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am not known to you.

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Though in your state of honor I am perfect.

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly if you will take a homely man's advice.

232
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Be not found here.

233
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hence with your little ones to fright you thus may think I am too savage.

234
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
To do worse to you were felt cruelty, which is too naive person.

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Heaven preserve you.

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I dare abide no longer.

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Exit, messenger.

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Whether should I fly.

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I have done no harm.

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But I remember now I am in this earthly world where to do harm is often lovable.

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
To do good sometimes I count a dangerous folly.

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why then, unless do I put up that womanly defense to say I have done no harm?

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What are these faces?

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Enter murderers.

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Where's your husband?

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I hope in no place so unsangified were such as thou may find him.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's a traitor.

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thou lieest thou shagyard villain?

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What you egg?

250
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Stubbing him.

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Young fry of treachery.

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He has killed me mother.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Run away.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I pray you.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Dies.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Exit Lady MacDuff crying murder followed by murderer.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Seen three, England, before the king's palace.

258
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Enter Malcolm and MacDuff.

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let us seek out some desolate shade in their weeper set bosom's empty.

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and like good men best ride our downfall, birthed him.

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Each new more new widows how, new orphans cry.

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
New sorrows strike heaven on the face that have resounds as if it felt with Scotland and Yelms.

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Scotland and Yelmed out like syllable of dollar.

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What I believe, I'll well.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What no believe and what I can redress.

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As I shall find the time to friend I will.

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What you have spoke and may be so perchance.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This tyrant who soul-named blisters our tongues was once thought honest.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You have loved him well. He has not touched you yet.

270
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb.

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
To peas and angry God.

272
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I am not treacherous but my path is.

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
A good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge.

274
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But I shall crave your pardon.

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace.

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yet grace must still look so.

279
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I have lost my hopes.

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Pretends even there where I did find my doubts.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why in that raunus left you wife in child those precious motives.

282
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Those strong knots of love without leave taking.

283
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I pray you.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let not my jealousy be your dishonors.

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But my own safeties.

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You may be rightly just whatever I shall think.

287
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Bleed, bleed poor country.

288
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure.

289
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
For goodness down I check thee.

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Well thou thy wrongs.

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The title is a feared.

292
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Fair thee well Lord.

293
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I would not be the villain that thou thinks.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
For the whole space that's in the tyrants grasp and the rich east to boot.

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Be not offended.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I speak not as an absolute fear of you.

297
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It weeps it bleeds in each new day.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
A gash is added to her wounds.

300
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think with all there would be hands uplifted in my right.

301
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And here from gracious England have I offer of goodly thousands.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But for all this, when I shall tread upon the tyrants head or wear it on my side.

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before.

304
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever.

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
By him that shall succeed.

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What should he be?

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It is my self I mean in whom I know all the particulars of vice so graffed.

308
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That when they shall be opened, black Macbeth will seem as pure as snow.

309
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compared with my confineless arms.

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Not in the legions of harrowed elk and come a devil more damned in even

311
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to top Macbeth.

312
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I grant him bloody legionious, avaricious, false, deceitful, sudden, malicious,

313
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
smacking of every sin that has a name.

314
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But there's no bottom none in my voluptuousness.

315
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Your wives, your daughters, your matrons and your maids could not fill up the

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
or bear that did oppose my will.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Better Macbeth than such and one to reign.

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Boudless in temperance in nature is a tyranny.

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It has been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings.

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But fear not yet to take upon you what is yours.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty and yet seem cold.

323
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The time you may so hoodwink.

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We have willing deems enough that cannot be that voucher in you to devour so many

325
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
as will to greatness dedicate themselves, finding it so inclined.

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
With this their grows in my most ill-composed affection such a stancheless

327
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Everest that where I king I should cut off the nobles for their lands, desire his

328
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
jewels and this other's house and my more having would be as a

329
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
suss to make me hunger more that I should forge quarrels unjust against the

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
good and loyal destroying them for wealth.

331
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This Everest sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root than some

332
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
of the most unforeseen lust and it has been the sword of our slain kings.

333
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yet do not fear, Scotland hath foysens to fill up your will of your mirrown, all these are

334
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
portable with other graces wade.

335
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But I have none.

336
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The king becoming graces as justice, verity, temperance, stavleness,

337
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
bounty, perseverance, mercy, loneliness, devotion, patience, courage,

338
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
fortitude, I have no relish of them, but abound in the division of each

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
several crime, acting it many ways.

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Nay had I power I should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, uproar the

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
universal peace, confound all unity on earth.

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh, Scotland, Scotland!

343
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If such a one be fit to govern speak, I am as I have spoken.

344
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Fit to govern, no, not to live, own nation miserable, with an unsightled,

345
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
tyrant bloody sceptored, when shall thou see thy wholesome days again, since that the

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
truest issue of thy throne, by his own introduction stands a curse, and as blasphemous

347
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
breed thy royal father was the most seated king, the queen the bore thee,

348
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
offender upon her knees than on her feet, died every day she lived, fair thee well.

349
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
These evils thou repeatest upon thy self have banished me from Scotland.

350
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh, my breast thy whole bends here.

351
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Make doth this noble passion, child of integrity, hath from my soul wiped the black

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
scruples, reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honor.

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Devilish mech, Beth, by many of these trains, hath sought to win me into his power and

354
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
modest wisdom plucks me, from over credulous haste, but God above,

355
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
deal between thee and me. For even now I put myself to thy direction, an unspeaked

356
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
mind-owned detraction, here abdure the taints and blanes I laid upon myself, for strangers

357
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
to my nature I am yet unknown to woman, never was for sworn.

358
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Scaresly have coveted what was my own, at no time broke my faith, would not betray the devil

359
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life. My first false speaking was this

360
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
upon myself. What I am truly is thine and my poor countries to command, wither indeed before

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
thy hear approach, my seward with ten thousand warlike men, already at a point was setting

362
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
forth, now we'll together in the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?

363
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once, to his heart to reconcile.

364
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Enter a doctor. Well, more and more, comes the king forth, I pray you.

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,320
I, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure. Their melody convinces the

366
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:58,000
great assay of art, but at his touch, such sanctity, have heaven given his hand they presently

367
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
amend. I thank you, doctor.

368
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Exit, doctor. What's the disease he means?

369
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
To his call, the evil. A most miraculous work in this good king, which often since my hear remain in

370
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
England, I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven, himself best knows, but strangely visited

371
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
people all swan and ulcerous pitiful to the eye, the mere despair of surgery he cures, hanging a golden stamp

372
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
about their necks, put on with holy prayers and to his spoken, to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing

373
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
action, with this strange virtue he had a heavenly gift of prophecy, and sundry blessings hang about his throne

374
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that speak him full of grace. Enter Ross. See who comes here. My countrymen, but yet I know him not.

375
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
My ever-gettle cousin, welcome, Hither. I know him now, good God, be times remove the means that makes a strangers.

376
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sir, a men. Stands Scotland where it did.

377
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Mass for country. Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot be called a mother, but a grave. Where nothing,

378
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
but who knows nothing is once seen to smile. Where size and groans and shrieks that rent the air are made,

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,000
not marked, where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy. The dead man's nell is their scarce asked for who.

380
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps, dying or are they sicken.

381
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh, relation to nice and yet too true. What's the newest grief?

382
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That of a now-as-age, Darth Hiss, the speaker, each minute teams a new one. How does my wife?

383
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Why well? And all my children? Well, too. The tyrant has not battered at their peace.

384
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No, they were well at peace when I did leave him. Be not a negative of your speech, how goes?

385
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
When I came here to transport the tidings of which I have heavily born, there ran a rumor of many worthy fellows that were out,

386
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
which was to my belief, witness the rather for the race or the tyrants power of what? Now is the time of help.

387
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Your eye in Scotland would create soldiers, make our women fight to tough their dire distresses.

388
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Beat their comfort, we are coming thither. Gracious England, Hathlentus, could seeward and 10,000 men,

389
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
an older and a better soldier, none, that Christendom gives out.

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What could I answer this comfort with the like? But I have words that would be hollowed out in the desert air.

391
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Where hearing should not latch them. What concern, thee? The general cause,

392
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
or is it a fee grief, due to some single breast?

393
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
No mind that's honest, but in it shares some woe, though the main part pertains to you alone.

394
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If it be mine, keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.

396
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I guess at it. Your castle is surprised. Your wife and babe savagely slaughtered.

397
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
To relate the manner where, on the quarry of these murder dare to add the death of you.

398
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Merciful heaven, what man, near pull your hat upon your brows, give sorrow words,

399
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
the grief that does not speak whisper as the or fraught heart and bids it break.

400
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
My children too. Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.

401
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And I must be from then. My wife killed two. I have said.

402
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Be comforted. Let's make us medicines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief.

403
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
He has no children. All my pretty ones. Do you say all? Oh, hell, kite? All?

404
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What all my pretty chickens under dam at one fell swoop disputed like a man?

405
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I shall do so, but I must also feel it as a man. I cannot but remember such things were that were most precious to me.

406
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Did heaven look on and would not take their pot?

407
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Sinful Macduff, they were all struck for thee, not that I am, not for their own merits, but for mine fell slother on their souls.

408
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Heaven rest them now. Be this the wheatstone of your sword. Let grief convert to anger, blunt, not the heart, in rage it.

409
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, I could play the woman with my eyes and brag it with my tongue, but jettle heavens cut short all into mission.

410
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Front to front bring thou this feigned of Scotland and myself within my swords length, set him.

411
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
If he escaped, heaven forgive him too.

412
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This time goes manly. Come go we to the king. Our power is ready. Our lack is nothing but our leave.

413
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Macbeth is right for shaking and the powers above put on their instruments.

414
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Receive what cheer you may, the night is long that never finds the day.

415
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Exit.
